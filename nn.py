#cluster of nodes that represent changes.... maybe a couple of digit nodes to pick out the number

#measure on correctness-divided-by-accuracy, or within time limit

#evolve total number nodes and starting connections (gotta figure out how many nodes each node should be initially connected to, should put it in the middle so it is equally likely to be an and gate or an or gate)
